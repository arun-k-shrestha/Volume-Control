This is an Advanced Computer Vision project. It helps you control the volume of your computer with hand gestures through the computer lens. I took help from freeCodeCamp.org to complete this project.

This project needs three important packages: OpenCv, Mediapipe, and osascript (for mac users)/ pycaw(for windows users)

I used ( pip3 install opencv-python ) for OpenCv to import cv2, (pip3 install mediapipe) to import mediapipe, and (pip3 install osascript) to import osascript

Volume Control is the main file, and Module is the secondary file with functions. 

Few lines of code might not run on Windows. So, Windows users should look at a YouTube video - "Advanced Computer Vision with Python -Full Course" from freeCodeCamp.org 

If you run into trouble, please don't hesitate to send me a message.
