# This is an Advanced Computer Vision project. It helps you control the volume of your computer with the hand gestures through computer lens. I took a help from freeCodeCamp.org to complete this project

#This project in under construction!!

#This projects need two important packages: OpenCv and Mediapipe

#I used ( pip3 install opencv-python ) for OpenCv to import cv2 and (pip3 install mediapipe) to import mediapipe

#OpenCv and mediapipe should be installed to import cv2 and mediapipe libraries respectively.

#For main volume control: osascript should be installed for mac users. For window users, pycaw should be installed (few code will lines will also be different, which is not shown in my project). For better info for window users, take a look at a youtube video - "Advanced Computer Vision with Python -Full Course" from freeCodeCamp.org
