This is an Advanced Computer Vision project. It helps you control the volume of your computer with the hand gestures through computer lens. I took a help from freeCodeCamp.org to complete this project

This project need three important packages: OpenCv, Mediapipe, and osascript(for mac users)/ pycaw(for window users)

I used ( pip3 install opencv-python ) for OpenCv to import cv2, (pip3 install mediapipe) to import mediapipe, and (pip3 install osascript) to import osascript

Volume Control is the main file, and Module is the secondary file with functions. 

Few lines of code might not run on window so window users should take a look at a youtube video - "Advanced Computer Vision with Python -Full Course" from freeCodeCamp.org
